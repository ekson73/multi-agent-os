# DEPRECATED

This directory is deprecated as of v1.0.0.

## Migration

Claude Code plugins do not use CLAUDE.md files. Instead:

- Use `README.md` in the plugin root for documentation
- Use `commands/`, `agents/`, `skills/` for plugin components
- Use `hooks/hooks.json` for lifecycle hooks

## Scheduled Removal

This directory will be removed in v2.0.0.
